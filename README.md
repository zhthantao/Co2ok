The goal of the app is to raise awareness about the carbon footprint of different food items in a multiplayer game. Players are given a recipe and are tasked with matching the ingredients. Each ingredient carries a specific carbon footprint and players have to acquire all elements for the recipe while minimizing their footprint. The ingredients are continuously cascading on the screen and players compete by trying to tap on the desired item. For example, when given the task to create a “cheeseburger”, participants must find onions, tomatoes, bread and protein (among other items). They have the choice to pick beef, tuna, bison for their protein as well as fruits and vegetables that are locally grown. Tapping on an ingredient, automatically adds it to the recipe list and players have the chance to evaluate their related carbon footprint. If the footprint is too high, players have the choice to remove the ingredient and try to find another. The game ends when one of the players completes their recipe. The winning player is the one who completed the list with the lower carbon footprint.

The game is build with Unity game engine and Photon networking API.
